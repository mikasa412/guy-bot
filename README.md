discord bot for my server!
has suggestions, reactbot, and more planned!

### current functionality:
- **/ping**: pings the api. mainly used for debug.
- **/suggest**: makes a poll in the voting channel. if passed, sends it to the to do list.
- **/setchannel**, **/setlogs**, **/setrole**, **/settimer**: sets things in the config, the tips in discord tell you more about each.
- **/register** and **/update**: adds/updates your server in the config file.
- **/viewconfig**: just outputs the current server's chunk of the json file.

**if for some reason you want to use this bot, remove the ".template" from ["config.json.template"](config.json.template) before running!**
there are a few custom emojis you need to change if you want to use this for yourself (this is just for my server, I'm fine if you use my code but the github is only up for archival)
